**Coding Journey / My Background
**
My interest towards artificial intelligence, data science and machine learning flourished after completing my MSc Health Psychology dissertation on the "Acceptability of Artificial Humans and Virtual Assistants in Healthcare within the UK". Therefore, I decided to take up online courses, hackathon, and personal projects such as:
- Python For Everybody (PY4E) by Charles Severance
- 100 Days of Code with Angela Yu
- Harvard CS50x
- Hackathon (Creating a project called Onaegis predicting bot/scam comments on YouTube)
- Personal projects include: social media scrapers, DDG scraper, MaxReach
- MaxReach = mass true personalization of emails through reading files, API calls of LinkedIn data, and utilizing data cleaning for appropriate character profile summaries of potential leads.
